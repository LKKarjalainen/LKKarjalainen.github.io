Contains exercises from various courses and other small programs.

audio_transcription allows the user to transcribe long audio files. Normally OpenAI's whisper model is limited to 30 seconds of audio. This script is a workaround for that limitation.

Audio_llm is an audio transcription and prompting script. Can be used just for transcribing large audio clips or prompting text with a llama.cpp compatible LLM. Main intended use is to do both (for example creating bullet points from a video lecture automatically).
